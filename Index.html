        <h3>Snigdha Lahiry</h3>
        <p>Northpoint is not just an institute, it's a journey which we undertake, a journey where I understood core principles in the world of marketing and research, but also a journey where I learned more about myself; I learned about the essence of working in a team, working with deadlines, expectations, and insights. It has been a rewarding learning experience, one I will always be thankful for having undertaken.</p>
